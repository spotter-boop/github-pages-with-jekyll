# Welcome to world of Potter

This page is for me to learn all about GitHub.  It has been quite some time, probably 18 years since I coded anything ! my god and I may have forgotten it all but , I can still learn stuff.
I need to learn all about Git to keep up with the yoof of today (well, sort of the yoof)
Plus, it will keep me entertained during yet another lockdown, who'd have thunk it eh? nobody possible could have guessed 
Anyway - so that is it.  My investigations back into coding and, who knows, one day I may build an app which will take over the world.  That'll learn y'all
